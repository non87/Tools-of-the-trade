# Tools of the Trade

Contains the material for the introduction to data analysis in Python taught at Harvard and Northwestern in Spring 2021. It provides a crash-course about numpy (scipy), pandas and matplotlib. 

## Running the Notebooks Locally

If you would like to run the code on your local machine, the easiest way is to create a `conda` environment for this workshop. After [installing conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), you can download the notebooks (or `git pull` this repository) and, then, type in your terminal:


       conda install -n tools -c conda-forge numpy scipy matplotlib pandas jupyter
       conda activate tools
       jupyter notebook

## Running the Notebooks Online
