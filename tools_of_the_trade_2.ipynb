A `pd.Series` is an **ordered and labeled unidimensional collection of homogenous elements**. Let's compare this to a `np.array`:\n",

    "2. *Ordered*, both the `np.array` and the `pd.Series` contain information about the order of the elements they contain;\n",
    "3. *Unidimensional* unlike a `np.array`, a `pd.Series` always has a unidimensional shape: it is a vector.\n",
    "3. *Homogenous*, both the `pd.Series` and the `np.array` can contain only elements of the same type (for example, `float` or `integer`), following their `dtype`. \n",
    "4. *No Fixed dimensions*, the dimension of a `pd.Series` can easily change after it is instantiated -- even if it is still more efficient to instantiate an object once.\n",
