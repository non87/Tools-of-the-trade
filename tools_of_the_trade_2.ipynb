    "Finally, we can go with fancy indexing on `pd.Series` as well -- even if I do not think this is the official name. This works both with `iloc[]` and with `loc[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Beware**: there is **no** fancy indexing on `pd.DataFrame` in the same way as there is on `np.array`. If you are in a situation where you need to use fancy indexing on `pd.DataFrame`, your best option is to convert the `pd.DataFrame` to a `np.array`, select the `np.array`, then convert the results to a `pd.DataFrame` or `pd.Sereis` if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this is a good time to notice that an `index` does not have to contain unique labels...but it should! We can use the method <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.reset_index.html>`.reset_index()`</a> to enforce that."

    "### Our Last Stop: The `pd.DataFrame`\n",
    "\n",
    "You made untill the last section of the workshop. Here, we will be using the most popular object of Pandas: the `pd.DataFrame`. Now, the `pd.DataFrame` is a **2-dimensional ordered and labeled collection of possibly inhomogenous data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *2-dimensional*, a `pd.DataFrame` has rows and columns\n",
    "2. *Ordered*, a `pd.DataFrame` has an order for both the columns and the rows it contains;\n",
    "3. *Labeled*, a `pd.DataFrame` has a label for both the rows and the columns. \n",
    "4. *Inhomogenous (possibly)*, the columns of a `pd.DataFrame` may have different `dtype`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, a `pd.DataFrame` is composed by different `pd.Series`, one per column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we will load some data. The data we will work with comes in a `csv` file. This is common, but not necessary: `pd` supports a wide range of different (tabular) file formats. We will use the function <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html>`read_csv`</a> to load the data. Notice that we indicate a URL as the source of the data and `pd` deals with it with no problems -- as long as the URL is publicly accessible. Most often, we will indicate a local path to a file we store in our machine instead of a URL. Moreover, the files we will load are csv...*almost* . Actually, their first rows are not well formatted. We tell `pd` to skip those using the `skiprow` argument. The result of loading data will be two `pd.DataFrame`s, one per file.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the data. We will load publicly-available tracking data from Metrica, containing the tracking data for an anonymized soccer match. That is to say, the file contains the x-y position of each player (and the ball) for the entirity of the match. The data is taken every 0.04 seconds -- corresponding to a \"frame\"."

    "Actually, this is just the surface of what you can do with the instruments we in the workshop.  Of course we could not cover everything -- for example, `pd.DataFrame` has an <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html>`apply()`</a> method that is very similar to `np.apply_along_axes()`. We could not cover more advanced topics like <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html>`groupby()`</a> or <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html>MultiIndex</a>. However, the best way to learn this more advanced topic is to face issues where they are necessary. Really, the best way to proceed from here is to practice and expand what we learned! "
