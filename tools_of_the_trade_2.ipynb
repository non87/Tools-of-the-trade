A `pd.Series` is an **ordered and labeled unidimensional collection of homogenous elements**. Let's compare this to a `np.array`:\n",

    "3. *Unidimensional* unlike a `np.array`, a `pd.Series` always has a unidimensional shape: it is a vector.\n",
    "3. *Homogenous*, both the `pd.Series` and the `np.array` can contain only elements of the same type (for example, `float` or `integer`), following their `dtype`. \n",
    "4. *No Fixed dimensions*, the dimension of a `pd.Series` can easily change after it is instantiated -- even if it is still more efficient to instantiate an object once.\n",

    "Finally, we can go with fancy indexing on `pd.Series` as well -- even if I do not think this is the official name. This works both with `iloc[]` and with `loc[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Beware**: there is **no** fancy indexing on `pd.DataFrame` in the same way as there is on `np.array`. If you are in a situation where you need to use fancy indexing on `pd.DataFrame`, your best option is to convert the `pd.DataFrame` to a `np.array`, select the `np.array`, then convert the results to a `pd.DataFrame` or `pd.Sereis` if needed. We will come back to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this is a good time to notice that an `index` does not have to contain unique labels...but it should! We can use the method `.reindex()` to enforce that."
